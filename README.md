# Salieri - PDX Capstone Build

## Overview
Salieri is a midi composition app.  It is in early stages of development, though it is already in a demo-able state and capable of composing some cool and helpful midi...even a little Mozart!

The current version had to be developed very quickly to be demo'd as a final project for a full stack coding boot camp (PDX Code Guild, class of 2022).  As such, much of the code is in need of polishing and commenting, and I have not yet added proper documentation.

I will make these improvements, as well as *drastically* expanding functionality, in time.  

The end goal is to create an accessible but powerful open source tool that can help users of all skill levels create their own music as midi.  Check back over time to see the project develop.

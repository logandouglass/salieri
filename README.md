# Salieri Demo (PDX Capstone Build)

## Overview
Salieri is a midi composition app that I developed as a capstone project at PDX Code Guild in summer 2022.  It utilizes my own music-writing algorithms written in Python (with the help of the mingus module) and is packaged in a Django web application.

While I have currently suspended development on Salieri to prioritize my professional work, utilizing music technology and writing music-making code remains a passion of mine.

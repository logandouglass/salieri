About Mutators

Mutators apply a range of effects to musical figures, and are a great way to inject variety and creativity into your MIDI.

Make musical figure longer; play it in reverse; send all the notes down an octave -- these are just a few of the sorts of effects you can apply with mutators.

Below you will find a list of all functional mutators included in the present demo version of Salieri.  Beneath each mutator you will find a list of all figure-writing functions that are compatible with that mutator.

mutators can be entered in any order separated by a space

for instance, the mutator string 

"o1 reach2 return" 

when applied to the arpeggio figure-writer will attempt to write an arpeggio that goes one full octave further, reaches 2 notes further into the next octave, and then walks back down. 


Mutators

bassifyn, for n 1-3
[arpeggio, simpline, strummer]

lowers base octave of a musical figure by n octaves

good for making basslines
--

trebifyn, for n 1-3
[arpeggio, simpline, strummer]

raises base octave of a musical figure by n octaves 

good for making lead figures stand out
--

invertn, for n 1-2
[arpeggio]

inverts the chord used to generate a musical figure by n notes

(the notes in an inverted chord are stacked differently, so that the tonic is not the lowest note)

on, for n 1-3
[arpeggio]

adds full octaves to a musical figure

good for making long, sweeping musical figures
--

reverse
[arpeggio]

arranges a musical figure in reverse
--

return
[arpeggio]

alternates placing a musical figure forwards and in reverse until the desired number of bars are filled
--

reachn, for n 1-3
[arpeggio]

modifies length of an arpeggion, causing it to overflow into the next octave by n notes.
--

delayn, for n 1-4
[arpeggio, simpline, strummer]

fills the beginning of a bar with n 1/4 rests before placing a musical figure
--

lingern, for n 1-8
[arpeggio]

places n of each note in the musical figure instead of 1
--

pn, for n 1
[simpline, strummer]

overrides the note denominator selected for a chord sequence, and instead places notes in a special, pre-arranged pattern

p1 - a dramatic, crashing pattern (12 12 12 8 8 2)

# Salieri Demo (PDX Capstone Build)

## Overview
Salieri is a music composition app that I solo-developed for a coding bootcamp in summer 2022.  It utilizes my own code to write custom downloadable music clips as MIDI, all packaged in a stylish web app! 

While I have currently suspended development on Salieri to prioritize my professional work, writing music-making code and working with MIDI remains a passion of mine.

My dream for Salieri is to create a user-friendly app that helps users write their own music without deep knowledge of music notation or DAW software.  I hope to return to the project someday soon!

This repository houses an early demo version that I presented at a student showcase in summer 2022 and hosted on Heroku.

Tech I worked with on the project included Python, Java Script, Django, Heroku, Vue.JS, HTML, CSS, Tachyons, SQLite, and a very handy Python module called mingus (highly recommended for Python users who like making music and playing with music theory).

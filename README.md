# Salieri Demo (PDX Capstone Build)

## Overview
Salieri is a midi composition app.  It is in early stages of development, though it is already in a demo-able state and capable of composing some cool and helpful midi...even a little Mozart!

The current version had to be developed very quickly to be demo'd as a final project for a full stack web development boot camp (PDX Code Guild, class of 2022).  As such, some of the code still needs polishing and commenting, and I am still working on updating the documentation.

I will make these improvements, as well as *drastically* expanding the functionality, in time.  

The end goal is to create an accessible but powerful open source tool that can help users of all skill levels create their and download their own own music clips as midi.  Check back over time to see the project develop.

You can try the demo version of Salieri at https://salierimidi.herokuapp.com/

Updates coming soon.
